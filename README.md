# Project A23

## Concept of game
1. **Starting:** The player begins standing in a field enclosed by a fence gate (the world border). Although there is a path leading out, the player finds it blocked by dark magic, preventing their escape. (Daytime)

2. **Phase 1:** The player must venture to the nearby house to gather essential items. Items can also be discovered in structures within the fenced area, accessible both day and night.

3. **Phase 2:** As night falls, sinister Whitemen emerge, patrolling the pathway. The player must hide or risk being caught and killed. If the player remains unseen, the Whitemen will retreat. If caught, they lose a life but retain their inventory items.

4. **Phase 3:** At dawn, a fearsome bluesoul materializes within the fenced area, launching an assault on the player. If the player manages to defeat the bluesoul, they gain no reward. However, if the player perishes, they lose all possessions.

5. **Phase 4 - 10:** The Whitemen become more attuned to disturbances, increasing their ability to detect the player at night, while the bluesoul grows stronger, inflicting greater damage during its attacks.

6. **Escape:** The player must locate a room containing a voodoo doll. Once obtained, they must expose the doll to sunlight and burn it within 10 phases. Upon burning the doll, all Whitemen and bluesouls perish, and the player is freed from the grasp of black magic. They can then exit via the pathway.

7. **Failure:** If the player fails to burn the doll, the bluesoul and Whitemen become so formidable that they can detect the player upon entering the pathway, with the bluesoul capable of slaying the player in a single hit.
